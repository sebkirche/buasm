The folders
--------

THE TITLES/ folder contains all the separated titles from RosAsm.
They are only here because from version to version, we can see the differences in code easily

The files
=-------
BUAsm.exe is the full compiled executable.
fixes-changes.txt is Je's changelog
moveTITLES.bat is my batch file that automatically moves the separated titles and the full source in the proper place.
readme.txt --- this file
version.txt -- a text file that contains the version number

How to work on BUAsm :

1. Work on BUAsm.exe like you usually do in RosAsm
2. When you are done with your changes, you need to save all TITLES.
3. Then you launch the batch file and everything gets cleaned up.
4. SVN-COMMIT
5. Don't forget the COMMIT message !
